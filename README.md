# House-Sales
 House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting house sales prices using various features of residential properties. The data includes multiple attributes related to house characteristics, such as size, location, quality, and other structural elements, which significantly impact the sale price. The goal of the project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the sales price for each house based on the provided features.

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, transforming categorical features into numerical form, and normalizing the data where necessary. Afterward, various machine learning models, including regression techniques and advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or CatBoost, are trained and evaluated for accuracy. Feature importance analysis helps to identify which features are most influential in determining house prices, providing insights into key drivers of value in the housing market.

The project aims to strike a balance between prediction accuracy and model interpretability, with a focus on creating a generalizable model for real-world applications. Performance is measured through cross-validation techniques and metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and the best-performing model is selected for final predictions.



## About the Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains numerous features related to residential properties, including both numerical and categorical data. Key variables include the house’s living area (square footage), number of bedrooms, bathrooms, garage space, and overall quality. In addition, location-based features, such as the neighborhood and proximity to amenities, are also present.

There are also several derived features, such as total house area and the age of the property at the time of sale. The dataset contains a mixture of continuous variables (e.g., sale price, living area), ordinal categorical variables (e.g., quality ratings), and nominal categorical variables (e.g., neighborhood). Some of the data required cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.


## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to predict the sales price of houses based on various features in the dataset. Each house in the dataset is identified by a uniqueID, and the objective is to build a predictive model that estimates the Sales Price of each house using a set of input features. These features could include information about the house's size, location, number of rooms, year of construction, and other property-specific characteristics.

The task involves using the training dataset to develop a model that can accurately predict the sales price of houses in the test dataset. Once the model is trained, it will be evaluated on unseen test data, and for each house in the test set, a prediction for the Sales Price will be generated.

The main steps for this project include:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables if necessary.
2. Feature Engineering: Identifying and selecting important features that impact the sales price of houses.
3. Modeling: Using regression models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, to predict the sales price.
4. Evaluation: Assessing the model’s performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
5. Prediction: Applying the trained model to the test set and predicting the sales price for each house.

This project aims to provide an accurate estimation of housing prices, which is useful for real estate businesses, property developers, and potential buyers for making informed decisions.


## Final Conclusion:
The project successfully predicts house sales prices with a reasonably high degree of accuracy, offering valuable insights into which property features most significantly affect prices. The most critical factors influencing house prices include the overall quality of the property, living area size, and neighborhood location.

The chosen model, after a series of evaluations, demonstrated robust performance on unseen data, confirming its ability to generalize well beyond the training set. The feature importance analysis revealed that while physical attributes like area and condition were major factors, neighborhood and location also contributed significantly to the price.

Further improvements could be made by incorporating additional external data, such as economic indicators or interest rates, which may provide a broader context for housing price fluctuations. The final model can serve as a useful tool for real estate professionals, home buyers, and investors seeking to estimate property values accurately.
